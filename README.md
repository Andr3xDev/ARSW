## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to centralize and document the practical work for the Software Architecture course. It serves as a comprehensive portfolio of projects that translate key theoretical concepts into practical, hands-on implementations.
The repository explores a wide range of crucial topics, including:

- Design and Architectural Patterns: Applying foundational design patterns and high-level architectural styles to build robust applications.
- Cloud-Native Principles: Developing services that adhere to the 12-Factor App methodology, ensuring they are built for scalability and declarative setup.
- Real-Time Systems: Building interactive, real-time applications using technologies like WebSockets for low-latency communication.
- Infrastructure and Concurrency: Delving into server-side concurrency, multithreading, and foundational networking infrastructure.
- API Consumption: Integrating third-party services by consuming external APIs, a core practice in modern distributed systems.

Each project is a focused exercise designed to solidify the understanding of these key areas in contemporary software engineering.

## üíº Projects done

Below is a description of each project developed during the course.

#### auth

- Description: An application that implements user authentication and authorization mechanisms. It likely includes features like user registration, login, and token-based security.
- Objective: To learn how to manage user identities & save them into a database.

#### board

- Description: A collaborative message board application. It might use WebSockets for real-time communication, allowing multiple users to see updates instantly.
- Objective: To practice real-time state management and build interactive, multi-user applications.

#### broker-test

- Description: A project for testing and implementing a message broker. This probably explores a publish-subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern with Redis.
- Objective: To understand asynchronous communication and decoupling components in a distributed system.

#### calculator

- Description: A simple calculator application. This could be a command-line tool or a web-based UI that processes mathematical expressions.
- Objective: To practice algorithmic logic, and basic user interface handling usin a MVC architecture.

#### chatGPT

- Description: An integration with the OpenAI API to build a chat interface powered by a large language model.
- Objective: To learn how to consume third-party, API-based services and handle asynchronous responses.

#### codelines

- Description: A utility tool to count the number of lines of code in a project, possibly filtering by file type and ignoring comments or blank lines.
- Objective: To practice file system I/O operations and text processing in Java.

#### concurrent-server

- Description: A server implementation designed to handle multiple client connections simultaneously using multithreading.
- Objective: To understand the fundamentals of concurrency, including thread management, synchronization, and avoiding race conditions.

#### intro-react

- Description: An introductory project to the React library for building basic user interfaces.
- Objective: To learn the core concepts of React, such as components.

#### lab1

- Description: The first laboratory assignment of the course, likely covering foundational concepts such as basic Java, data structures, or initial setup.
- Objective: To establish a baseline of knowledge and skills for the rest of the course.

#### matrix-game

- Description: A game or simulation that operates on a matrix structure.
- Objective: To practice algorithmic problem-solving and the manipulation of two-dimensional data structures.

#### mvc

- Description: An application built following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
- Objective: To understand and apply the principle of separation of concerns by dividing an application into data (Model), presentation (View), and logic (Controller).

#### networking

- Description: A project focused on low-level networking concepts, likely using Java Sockets to implement client-server communication over TCP/IP.
- Objective: To understand the fundamentals of network protocols and socket programming.

#### oodesign

- Description: A project focused on applying Object-Oriented Design principles and patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer).
- Objective: To learn how to design flexible, scalable, and maintainable software systems using established design patterns.

#### persistence

- Description: An application that connects to a database to perform data persistence operations.
- Objective: To learn how to integrate a database into an application using technologies like JDBC or an ORM like JPA/Hibernate.

#### project

- Description: The final course project, which integrates multiple technologies and architectural concepts learned throughout the semester into a single, comprehensive application.
- Objective: To demonstrate mastery of the course material by designing and building a complete software solution.

#### repositories

- Description: An implementation of the Repository design pattern to abstract the data access layer.
- Objective: To create a clean separation between the business logic and the data source, making the application easier to test and maintain.

#### restful-app

- Description: A web application that exposes a RESTful API for clients to consume.
- Objective: To learn how to design and build APIs following REST principles, including proper use of HTTP verbs, status codes, and resource-based URLs.

#### tic-tac-toe

- Description: A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation.
- Objective: To practice fundamental programming logic, state management, and user input handling in a simple application.

#### websocket

- Description: A project demonstrating real-time, bidirectional communication between a client and a server using the WebSocket protocol.
- Objective: To build interactive applications that require low-latency communication, such as chats or live-updating dashboards.
